**********************WebDriver Waits*************************
1. Implicit
2. Explicit

Implicit wait---> it is a global wait and is going to wait until the WebElement is found.

Explicit wait---> is conditional wait that is going to wait until a condition is fulfilled.

syntax:
    WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver.timeOut);

    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent(element));


    Can we use both implicit and explicit wait in the same code?
    YES

    always have implicit wait in start, it is a good practice
