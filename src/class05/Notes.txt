Approach to select the check box single
1-inspect the checkbox
2-write down the correct locator in the Dom
3- use find element then find the checkbox
4-click on it

    if I want to check that checkbox is selected or not?
        checkbox.isSelected(); ---> (means selected)

Preferred Approach when it comes to multiple checkboxes
    1- inspect them in the Dom
    2- write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
    3- use find Elements to get all those checkboxes
    4- iterate through the list
    5- while iteration look for your desired checkbox(inspect the Dom to see which information provides you then indication
    that this is your desired checkbox)
    6- if condition to make the selection

    Drop Down: ----> two types:
    1- Single select
    2- Multi select
    -------------------
    When it comes to drop Down we have a class in selenium that helps us interact with them
    ------> Select class;---->in order to be able to use this class yur drop down must be made in the DOM using SELECT tag.
    Approach:
        1- inspect the Drop Down
        2- check if it has the select tag
        3- Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
        4- Declare an object of the select class(pass the WebElement in the parameters)
        5- use methods from select class to select the desired option.
        ---->selectByVisibleText();
        byValue();
        byIndex();

Multi Select Drop Down---->
Approach:
    1. inspect the drop down
    2. check f it has the select tag
    3. write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
    4. Declare an object of the select class (pass the Web Element in the parameters)
    5. use methods from select class to select the desired option


    --> you can use Deselect Methods also in case of multi select drop down


    --> to check if the dropDown is multiselect or not you can use isMultiSelect --> returns a boolean true if it is a multi select drop down

    --> in select by index
    indexing starts from 0 if first option is not disabled
    indexing starts from 1 if first option is disabled



    -------------------------Alerts------------------------------------------

    alerts are the pop up windows that appear without dealing with them you can not
    proceed on with doing anything else

    you cannot inspect them

    1. Java Script alerts --->
    2. HTML base based alerts / pop ups --> we can deal with how we deal with other web elements
    3. Window based --> we can not deal with them using seleium

    Java Script alerts:
    1. Simple alert -->
    2. Confirmation Alert
    3. Prompt Alert


    you deal with all of them in the exact same way
